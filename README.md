## Print Instructions
All of the 3D printed parts are printed in PLA. Lightweight PLA may be suitable but has not been tested.
Print settings are:
- 0.3mm Layer Height
- Cubic 10% Infill
- No supports
Unless stated otherwise.

### Flat Components
![Flat Parts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/471cbd54-4bba-4b89-b405-6d21c221ced3)
Print the following number of each flat part in the orientation shown above:
| Number | Part |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Rib |
| 3 | Servo Horn |
| 2 | Wing Cap |
| 1 | Frame |

### Fixtures
![Fixtures](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0964a386-a867-4c9a-b8b2-eec28e54f752)
Print the following number of each fixture component in the orientation shown above
| Number | Part |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Wing Brace |
| 2 | Motor Pod |
| 1 | Tail Boom Fixture |
| 1 | Empannage Fixture |

### Hatch Components
![Hatch Parts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1be1a6a-7b71-4b93-9d84-648461b41180)
Print one of each Hatch and Lid components in the orientation shown above. This requires support material on the Hatch component as a minimum, and the Lid also benefits from the stability of adding support. A raft or brim, or slower print speed may help if the Lid component is struggling to adhere to the bed. After printing, install the M3 threaded insert / nut into the 5mm hole in the hatch component using a soldering iron.

### Nose
![Nose](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ff418b8-ae34-4107-9263-cecae1d8b4da)
Print the nose in the orientation shown above, with the front face flat on the build plate.

If you are using the Analog 22mm nose or the Vista nose, supports should not be required. If you are using the O4 Lite nose then supports are needed, but only to support the USB port. Place a support enforcer such that it covers the "top" part of the usb hole that will need support. You could also enable support everywhere and spend time picking it out, or disable supports completely and file away any sag that may have occured.

## Cutting Foam Parts
 The foam parts are all made from generic Readi-Board from the dollar store. Science fair foam board is not suitable for this model, as it is too dense. The PDF plans are designed to tile and be taped together to form patterns that can be adhered to the stock foamboard with temporary glue, then cut out with a hobby knife. There are 4 sets of patterns, HS (Horizontal Stab.), sides, and tops all have 3 sheets, and the wings pattern has 10 sheets. The wings pattern is made from 2 rows of 5 sheets, with the numbering starting in the top left, going left to right, then repeating on the lower row. The vertical stabilizer pattern is small enough to be printed on one sheet.
 I reccomend you calibrate your printer using the 35mm square on the sides3 pdf. To do this, print sides3 at a scale of 100% (never scale to fit) and measure the square with calipers. Then when you print the patterns set the scale equal to: 100 * (35 / your measurement). While cutting out the parts, only cut the very outline for now. The assembly section will give instructions on what to do with the other lines.

 ## Assembly
 The assembly goes much like most Flite Test aircraft, start by building the wings first, then assemble the empennage, then integrate everything as you finish with the fuselage.

 ### Wings
 The wings of the C-01 are inspired by the wings of the FT-3D, I highly encourage you to watch the wings section of the FT-3D build video to see how to score and bevel the lines marked in the wing. Before starting, cut the gray sliver that crosses the leading edge out of the wing, this is where the motor pod will attach. The assembly of the C-01 wings is almost identical to this video, apart from using 3D printed forms to give the wing its shape instead of using foam and the spar. First score the fold lines, and double-bevele the leading edge, and single bevele the aileron on the control surface side. Then glue the Rib component at the root of the wing such that it will force the wing to take the airfoil shape, then do the same with the Wing Cap component at the wingtip. Now follow the gluing and folding procedure in the FT-3D video, but skip the steps where Josh glues down the strips of foam and installs the spar, the C-01 spar goes in at final assembly. Make sure to hold, clamp, or press the wing into shape while the hot glue cools. After the wing is cool, attach the motor to the motor pod, then clear any excess glue away from the slot where the motor pod will go. Test fit the motor pod, both pods are identical, but they have a right side up that is flipped for opposite wings. The pod should sit flush against the wing on both sides, and face forward. Note that because the wings are swept, this has the effect of making it look like the motor is pointing towards the wing root before it is attached to the aircraft. If the motor pod is pointing towards the wingtip, it is on backwards. This is also a good time to ensure the motor wires are pointing in a good direction. Once you are sure the motor pod is set up right, insert the motor pod slightly to keep glue from getting on the half-circle where it will touch the wing spar (this is here to help keep the aircraft square during final assembly) then apply a generous amount of glue anywhere the pod will contact the foam. Clean the excess glue off before it cools. Finally glue the Wing Brace component to the root of the wing, such that its rearmost part lies on the hinge axis. This part will bridge the gap between the wing and the fuselage. Repeat these steps for the other wing. When finished, it should look like this:
