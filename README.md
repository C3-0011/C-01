### Hatch Components
![Hatch Parts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1be1a6a-7b71-4b93-9d84-648461b41180)
Print one of each Hatch and Lid components in the orientation shown above. This requires support material on the Hatch component as a minimum, and the Lid also benefits from the stability of adding support. A raft or brim, or slower print speed may help if the Lid component is struggling to adhere to the bed. After printing, install the M3 threaded insert / nut into the 5mm hole in the hatch component using a soldering iron.

### Nose
![Nose](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ff418b8-ae34-4107-9263-cecae1d8b4da)
Print the nose in the orientation shown above, with the front face flat on the build plate.

If you are using the Analog 22mm nose or the Vista nose, supports should not be required. If you are using the O4 Lite nose then supports are needed, but only to support the USB port. Place a support enforcer such that it covers the "top" part of the usb hole that will need support. You could also enable support everywhere and spend time picking it out, or disable supports completely and file away any sag that may have occured.

## Cutting Foam Parts
The foam parts are all made from generic Readi-Board from the dollar store. Science fair foam board is not suitable for this model, as it is too dense. The PDF plans are designed to tile and be taped together to form patterns that can be adhered to the stock foamboard with temporary glue, then cut out with a hobby knife. There are 4 sets of patterns, HS (Horizontal Stab.), sides, and tops all have 3 sheets, and the wings pattern has 10 sheets. The wings pattern is made from 2 rows of 5 sheets, with the numbering starting in the top left, going left to right, then repeating on the lower row. The vertical stabilizer pattern is small enough to be printed on one sheet.

I reccomend you calibrate your printer using the 35mm square on the sides3 pdf. To do this, print sides3 at a scale of 100% (never scale to fit) and measure the square with calipers. Then when you print the patterns set the scale equal to: 100 * (35 / your measurement). While cutting out the parts, only cut the very outline for now. The assembly section will give instructions on what to do with the other lines.

 ## Assembly
 The assembly goes much like most Flite Test aircraft, start by building the wings first, then assemble the empennage, then integrate everything as you finish with the fuselage.

 ### Wings
 The wings of the C-01 are inspired by the wings of the FT-3D, I highly encourage you to watch the wings section of the FT-3D build video to see how to score and bevel the lines marked in the wing. Before starting, cut the gray sliver that crosses the leading edge out of the wing, this is where the motor pod will attach. The assembly of the C-01 wings is almost identical to this video, apart from using 3D printed forms to give the wing its shape instead of using foam and the spar. First score the fold lines, and double-bevele the leading edge, and single bevel the aileron on the control surface side. Then glue the Rib component at the root of the wing such that it will force the wing to take the airfoil shape, then do the same with the Wing Cap component at the wingtip. Now follow the gluing and folding procedure in the FT-3D video, but skip the steps where Josh glues down the strips of foam and installs the spar, the C-01 spar goes in at final assembly. Inserting (but not gluing) the motor pod may help ensure the wing takes the proper shape. Make sure to hold, clamp, or press the wing into shape while the hot glue cools. Take the motor pod out if you inserted it. After the wing is cool, attach the motor to the motor pod, then clear any excess glue away from the slot where the motor pod will go. Test fit the motor pod, both pods are identical, but they have a right side up that is flipped for opposite wings. The pod should sit flush against the wing on both sides, and face forward. Note that because the wings are swept, this has the effect of making it look like the motor is pointing towards the wing root before it is attached to the aircraft. If the motor pod is pointing towards the wingtip, it is on backwards. This is also a good time to ensure the motor wires are pointing in a good direction. Once you are sure the motor pod is set up right, insert the motor pod slightly to keep glue from getting on the half-circle where it will touch the wing spar (this is here to help keep the aircraft square during final assembly) then apply a generous amount of glue anywhere the pod will contact the foam. Clean the excess glue off before it cools. Finally glue the Wing Brace component to the root of the wing, such that its rearmost part lies on the hinge axis. This part will bridge the gap between the wing and the fuselage. Repeat these steps for the other wing. When finished, it should look like this:

### Empennage

Push the Empennage Fixture onto one end of the 16mm carbon fiber tube, pushing it all the way until it is flush. Score and bevel the elevator hinge, beveling on the control surface side, 40mm from the trailing edge of the horizontal stabilizer. Clean the slots in the empennage fixture that the stabilizers will fit into. First push the horizontal stabilizer into place, then the vertical stabilizer. Some CA glue can be used to secure the stabilizers to the fixture, and the fixture to the carbon fiber tube. Cut a space into the vertical stabilizer for the elevator servo, and install a 9g servo there. This is a good time to create and attach the linkages. Use one of the 3D printed servo horns on the elevator. Make sure that the hole in the servo horn is directly above the hinge line when it is glued in place and in the neutral position. You can feed the servo wire through the carbon fiber tube with an extension.

Next install the Tail Boom Fixture onto the other end of the carbon fiber tube. This fixture will sit 63mm from the fuselage end of the tube. Note that this piece is taller than it is wide, and needs to be attached as such. Ensure that it is 63mm from the end of the tube with the "pointy" end facing the empennage, and that it is square with the tail surfaces, then glue it in place with some CA. It should look like this now:

### Final Assembly
First install your video system into your nose of choice. Then take your top and bottom pieces, and remove the paper from one side of them. Next using your calipers score a line 4.4mm from the sides of the top and bottom pieces along the exposed foam. Cut along this line to (but not through) the bottom paper, then remove the piece of foam, these will form a "B" style assembly in the finished fuselage. Next glue the frame piece onto the forward end of the tail boom, making sure it is square (the holes will go up and the "bottom" of the 3d print will be flush with the end of the tube). Then glue the tail boom assembly to the "Bottom" foam piece, applying hot glue under the tail boom fixture and frame pieces. It may be helpful to preform the foam before every step so it takes the bendy shape easily. Next glue the nose piece onto the bottom foam piece, it will sit flush with the bottom as the piece of the nose slots on/over the bottom piece. Next cut the 10mm holes out of the side pieces. Then remove the paper from the inside back section of the side pieces and preform them to the shape they need to take. Add lots of glue along one side of the paper on the edge of the bottom piece, and the side of the nose, frame, and tail boom fixture pieces, and push the corresponding side foam piece onto the bottom piece, forming both the side and bottom to take eachother's shape as the glue cools, then repeat this on the other side. Next tack the 10mm carbon tube in place inside the spar holes, centered over the airframe. Next grab one wing. Test fit the wing, ensuring that the spar does not snag as it is inserted. You should feel how it locates onto the half-circle on the end of the motor pod. Once you are sure the fit is good, apply a generous amount of hot glue onto anywhere the wing will contact the fuselage, and push it firmly against the fuselage. While the glue dries, make sure the wing is parallel to the tail boom. The C-01 has a designed angle of incidence of zero, and the wings are coplanar with the tail boom to make alignment by eye easier. Repeat this with the other wing. Once both wings are installed, install the aileron servos forward of the "Frame" piece. This will involve cutting a hole for them in the fuselage sides underneath the wings. Then install the servo horns and linkages. Then install the reciever behind the wing spar, and put together and test the electrical system. Once the top is on it will be very difficult to access this area, so ensure everything is working properly before moving forward. When you are ready to put the top on, add glue everywhere it will contact the fuselage, and press it into place. Next cut a 58mmx117mm hole in the top plate, with the front edge of the hole 13mm from where the top plate meets the nose piece. Glue the Hatch piece into this hole, and add fuzzy velcro to the space beneath it to secure a battery.

I will add photos here when I rebuild my fuselage this week.

## Misc

The C-01 is designed to be flown with the motors on seperate channels for differential thrust, and the aileron servos on independent channels so that flaperons can be configured. Give the control surfaces roughly 30 degrees of deflection, and I'd reccomend 20-30 percent expo. I fly my C-01 with a 3s 2200, however with the the speced motors, props, and escs, it should be capable of 4s without burning any electronics. Balance the C-01 roughly over the spar.
